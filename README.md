## Getting Started

### Installation

> The ModSync Updater (client-only) requires the 
> [.NET 8.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.11-windows-x64-installer).
> If you use the launcher, you'll have it, but dedicated clients may need to manually install it.

1. Download the latest version of the mod from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/c-orter/modsync/releases) page
2. Extract into your SPT folder like any other mod
3. Start the server

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you install all the files to both the server and the client. They are all required!
>
> ***Yes. Even the .exe***

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial release
- [x] Super nifty GUI for notifying user of mod changes and monitoring download progress
- [x] Ability to exclude files/folders from syncing from both client and server
- [x] Custom folder sync support (May be useful for cached bundles? or mods that add files places that aren't BepInEx/plugins, BepInEx/config, or user/mods)
- [x] Maybe cooler progress bar/custom UI (low priority)
- [x] External updater to prevent file-in-use issues
- [ ] Allow user to upload their local mods folders to host. (Needs some form of authorization, could be cool though)
- [ ] Buttons to sync from the BepInEx config menu (F12)
- [x] Real tests?!? (low priority)
