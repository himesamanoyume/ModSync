## How Sync Works

[How Sync Works](./wiki/How-Sync-Works)

If you are looking to understand how syncing works, take a look at the technical writeup on the wiki. It goes into detail on the different stages of the sync process
and different modes of operation.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial release
- [x] Super nifty GUI for notifying user of mod changes and monitoring download progress
- [x] Ability to exclude files/folders from syncing from both client and server
- [x] Custom folder sync support (May be useful for cached bundles? or mods that add files places that aren't BepInEx/plugins, BepInEx/config, or user/mods)
- [x] Maybe cooler progress bar/custom UI (low priority)
- [x] External updater to prevent file-in-use issues
- [ ] Allow user to upload their local mods folders to host. (Needs some form of authorization, could be cool though)
- [ ] Buttons to sync from the BepInEx config menu (F12)
- [x] Real tests?!? (low priority)
